Some thought:
What's the relation ship between Login User and Profile
Should we do create default profile when user logged in without Team defined ?

Only Logged in User can define Team
Only Logged in User can define Profile

When user signup we should able to create profile for it.
When user create team profile we should associate team with profile

Edit theme html to check if user has profile
